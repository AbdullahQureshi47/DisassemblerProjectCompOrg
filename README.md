# Disassembler Programming Project

See [Disassembler PP](www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs230/Projects/DisassemblerProj.html)
for the instructions for this assignment, coding tips, links to helpful
documents, and submission requirements.

The Disassembler project builds upon the Disassembler Utility functions you
have already written: `verifyMIPSInstruction` and `binToDec`.
It also uses the other header files and utility functions that were
provided to you for that project, such as `same.h`, `printFuncs.h`,
`processArguments` (`.c` and `.h`), `printDebug.c`, and `printError.c`, etc.

Thus, the first thing to do for this project is to copy (and commit) the
contents of your DisUtils project into this repository, and make any
changes suggested in the feedback to that project.

Once you start working on the Disassembler project itself, note that the
Makefile provided to you for the DisUtil project included rules for
compiling the Disassembler also.  You will want to change the definition of
the `all` target to include both disUtil and disassembler (as suggested in
the comments).

Following agile development principles, repeatedly Edit, Test, and Add/Commit
until the program is done. You can `git push` to Kit as often as you want.
(See the [Working with Git Repositories in
Kit](http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/CSShared/HelpFiles/Kit/RepositoryAssignments.md)
document for more information about writing a program within a Git
repository.)

When you are ready to submit your work, click on the "Turn In"
button. (You should still be able to push further changes to Kit
after turning an assignment in if you need to.)
