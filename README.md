# Disassembler Programming Project

## Early C, and first step towards Disassembler project

See [Disassembler PP](www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs230/Projects/DisassemblerProj.html)
for the instructions for this assignment, coding tips, links to helpful
documents, and submission requirements.

Following agile development principles, repeatedly Edit, Test, and Add/Commit
until the program is done. You can `git push` to Kit as often as you want.
(See the [Working with Git Repositories in
Kit](http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/CSShared/HelpFiles/Kit/RepositoryAssignments.md)
document for more information about writing a program within a Git
repository.)

When you are ready to submit your work, click on the "Turn In"
button. (You should still be able to push further changes to Kit
after turning an assignment in if you need to.)
